# Green Screen Processor for Shia LaBeouf
## What It Does
Take this image of Shia LaBeouf with a green screen behind him.  

<img alt='Shia LaBeouf' width='50%' height='50%' align='center' src='lib/09-Sep-18_00-52-96.png'>

The above image of Shia LaBeouf is from the famous meme where Shia stands in front of a green screen giving a strangely effective motovational speech.

Superimpose Shia on the below image of me and friends.

## How It Works


## Next Steps
Notice the green outline of our hero, Shia LaBeouf, in the final image.  
Fine tuning the chroma key algorithm to detect a greater range of greens could result in a cleaner image.  

## Libraries Used
`os` for writing our RGB values to find threshold in foreground image.  
`pillow` or _Python Image Library_ to manipulate images on a pixel level.
